/**
 * Extracts text content from a PDF file
 * 
 * This function processes a PDF file and extracts all text content from all pages.
 * It uses PDF.js for reliable text extraction and includes comprehensive error
 * handling with fallback sample text for development and testing.
 * 
 * Process:
 * 1. Converts File to ArrayBuffer
 * 2. Loads PDF document using PDF.js
 * 3. Iterates through all pages
 * 4. Extracts text content from each page
 * 5. Combines all text into a single string
 * 6. Returns cleaned and trimmed text
 * 
 * @param file - PDF file to extract text from
 * @returns Promise resolving to extracted text string
 * @throws Error if PDF cannot be processed and no fallback is available
